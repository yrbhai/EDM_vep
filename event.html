            1. The Virtual Estate Experience
            One of the most unique virtual event examples on this list, Quintessa’s Virtual Estate Experience brings you
            to
            the Quintessa Estate vineyard in Napa Valley, California for a one-of-a-kind tour. The tour is hosted via
            Zoom
            and features a private tasting of wines that are sent to registrants prior to the experience.

            “I had been wishing for an in-person getaway for a visit, but this worked nicely as a substitute,” one
            TripAdvisor user wrote. “The gathering was professionally organized with tasting kits available for the ‘at
            home’ experience. … This was not a perfect substitute for the in-person glass pavilion tasting experience
            (which
            is fabulous), but it was a great distraction from COVID-19 distancing. Thanks for the creativity!”
